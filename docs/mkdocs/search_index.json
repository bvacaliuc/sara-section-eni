Additionally, amateur astronomers have opportunities to use professional radio telescopes that have become available through public outreach grants.\n\n\nNRAO 40 Foot Dish and Jansky Antenna\n\n\nThe Forty-foot Telescope, was constructed in the early 60s for the purpose of determining if radio sources are variable. The Forty Foot Telescope is currently an educational instrument available to SARA members.  The NRAO also is host to a replica of Jansky's original antenna, also available to SARA members.\n\n\nRelated Radio Astronomy Project(s) and/or Information:\n\n\nhttps://science.nrao.edu/facilities/gbt/other-telescopes/40foot\n\n\nUNC Skynet and On-line Radio Telescope Resources\n\n\nSKYNET is a distributed network of robotic telescopes operated by students, faculty, and staff at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, and is available to SARA members upon request.\n\n\nRelated Radio Astronomy Project(s) and/or Information:\n\n\nhttp://skynet.unc.edu/introastro/\n\n\nArduino\n\n\nArduino is a single-board micro-controller, intended to make the application of interactive objects or environments more accessible, and has radio astronomy applications.\n\n\nRelated Radio Astronomy Project(s) and/or Information:\n\n\nhttp://cygnusa.blogspot.com/2013/02/arduino-and-radio-skypipe.html\n\n\nRaspberry Pi\n\n\nThe Raspberry Pi is a credit-card sized computer that plugs into your TV and a keyboard. It is a capable little computer that can be used in electronics projects, including radio astronomy applications.\n\n\nRelated Radio Astronomy Project(s) and/or Information:\n\n\nhttp://radioadastra.blogspot.com.au/2013/08/receiving-radio-noise.html\n\n\nSoftware Defined Radio (SDR)\n\n\nSDR is defined as radio in which some or all of the physical layer functions are software defined.  SDR is a radio communication system where components that have been typically implemented in hardware (e.g. mixers, filters, amplifiers, modulators/demodulators, detectors, etc.) are instead implemented by means of software on a personal computer.
